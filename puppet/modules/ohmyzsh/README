ohmyzsh

This is the oh-my-zsh module. It installs oh-my-zsh for a user and changes
their shell to zsh. It has been tested under Ubuntu.

oh-my-zsh is a community-driven framework for managing your zsh configuration.

This module is called ohmyzsh as Puppet does not support hyphens in module
names.
